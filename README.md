The API that I used was pokeapi. This api can tell you all different characteristics, but for this 
implementation I only used the pokemon's name, id number, height, and weight. The default pokemon that is
being used in the build currently is charizard and this is what the output should look like:
{
    "name": "charizard",
    "id": 6,
    "height": 17,
    "weight": 905
}
Charizard can be changed within the RestApiController class to any other pokemon you can think of
to get the information correlating with the pokemon you choose.
